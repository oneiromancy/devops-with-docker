# example-frontend

This project is created to help learn docker configurations for frontend projects. The README starting from "Prerequisites" is written without Docker in mind so student has to figure out how to construct their configuration based on the README. However, there are some additional helpers added in the README and in the exercise description.

> Notice, that all the information are not needed in all the exercises. Don't just copypaste.

# Prerequisites

Install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). 

Example node install instructions for LTS node 14.x:
```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash
sudo apt install -y nodejs
```

Check your install with `node -v && npm -v`

Install all packages with `npm install`

# Starting in production mode

## Exercise 1.12 -> to run the project

First you need to build the static files with `npm run build`

This will generate them into `build` folder.

An example for serving static files:

Use npm package called serve to serve the project in port 5000:
- install: `npm install -g serve`
- serve: `serve -s -l 5000 build`

Test that the project is running by going to <http://localhost:5000>

## Exercise 1.14 -> to connect to backend

By default the expected path to backend is /api. This is where the application will send requests. 
To manually configure api path run with `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` environment value set, for example `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://example.com npm run build`
